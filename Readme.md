# Folded concave Laplacian spectral penalized models

This package implements the folded concave Laplacian spectral (FCLS) penalized methods described in [The folded concave Laplacian spectral penalty learns block diagonal sparsity patterns with the strong oracle property](TODO: arxiv link). 


# Installation

`fclsp` can be installed via github

```
# first install version 0.0.0 of ya_glm
pip install git+https://github.com/idc9/ya_glm.git@v0.0.0

pip install git+https://github.com/idc9/fclsp

```
`fclsp` currently only works with an early version of `ya_glm`; `fclsp` will soon be updated to work with more current versions.


# Help and Support

Additional documentation, examples and code revisions are coming soon.
