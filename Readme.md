# Folded concave Laplacian spectral penalized models

This package implements the folded concave Laplacian spectral (FCLS) penalized methods described in [The folded concave Laplacian spectral penalty learns block diagonal sparsity patterns with the strong oracle property](TODO: arxiv link). 


# Installation

`fclsp` can be installed via github
```
git clone https://github.com/idc9/ya_glm.git
python setup.py install
```
To use `fclsp` you must first install [ya_glm](https://github.com/idc9/ya_glm).


# Help and Support

Additional documentation, examples and code revisions are coming soon.
